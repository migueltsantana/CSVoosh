# Why?

Data is growing faster and faster and exponentially. It has been crucial to process these large amounts of data at record speeds. However, data is often found in many other formats or locations other than a database. Because of this, it's important to ensure that they are housed in these technologies and enable their immediate analysis.

## Is there a need for it?

When there is a need to put large amounts of data stored in CSV files, this tool is very useful to get the databases populated in a short time.

This tool uses Python's multiprocessing library to slit the file into multiple parts, make connections to the database and parallelize tasks.
